# SubsTrack
 Builded and Deploy my First Production-Ready API

# Tutorial
I learn this API with JavaScript Mastery.
So this repository contains the code corresponding to an in-depth tutorial available on our YouTube channel, JavaScript Mastery.

# Introduction
Build a production-ready Subscription Management System API that handles real users, real money, and real business logic.

Authenticate users using JWTs, connect a database, create models and schemas, and integrate it with ORMs. Structure the architecture of your API to ensure scalability and seamless communication with the frontend.
